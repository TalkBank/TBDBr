Description: The purpose of TalkBankDB is to provide an intuitive on-line interface
for researchers to explore TalkBank's media and transcripts, specify data to be extracted,
and pass these data on to statistical programs for further analysis. We hope to: (1) Increase accessibility:
Previously, browsing TalkBank required knowing the name of a corpus or area of research,
finding its location within the talkbank.org domain (ex: fluency.talkbank.org),
then browsing/downloading the media and annotations and installing the CLAN tools.
To make these resources more accessible, TalkBankDB provides a single online interface to
query across all of TalkBank to find relevant corpora and links to media and transcripts.
Users can visually explore data directly in the browser, and if desired, download it for
further analysis in a statistical software package. (2) Grow community and foster collaboration:
With the entirety and richness of TalkBank freely accessible from a simple web interface,
resources that were previously known only by advanced users will be open to a broader community.
Features such as word usage, utterance length, measures of language acquisition speed and
ability by demographics can easily be selected, output, plotted, and analyzed through the web interface.
By also providing a GitHub account link for users to upload scripts and analyses,
the TalkBankDB site provides a single point where users can explore, share their research,
and see what others are doing in the TalkBank community.
